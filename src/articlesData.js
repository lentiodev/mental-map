    content: `How do I know if someone has a mental health problem?
    Sometimes it will seem obvious when someone is going through a hard time, but there is no simple way of knowing if they have a mental health problem. Sometimes you don’t need to know. It’s more important to respond sensitively to someone who seems troubled than to find out whether or not they have a diagnosis.
    
    Although certain symptoms are common with specific mental health problems, no two people behave the same way when unwell. You may notice changes in their behaviour or mood if you know the person well.
    
    How can I help?
    There are many ways you can help a friend, relative or colleague who has a mental health problem:
    
    Talking about mental health
    It can be challenging to know what to do if you are worried about someone. When you know there is an issue, it is essential not to wait. Waiting and hoping they will come to you for help might lose valuable time getting them support.
    
    Talking to someone is often the first step when you know they are having a hard time. This way, you can find out what is troubling them and what you can do to help.`,

    content: `In the context of a once in a generation cost-of-living crisis alongside the lingering effects of the COVID pandemic, Scotland’s mental health has perhaps never been as at risk as it is today. Already in May of this year, in a UK representative poll carried out by the Money and Mental Health Institute, six in ten (59%) UK adults said that the cost-of-living crisis has had a negative impact on their mental health, such as feeling anxious, depressed or hopeless.

    Mental health problems cost the Scottish economy £8.8 billion in 2019, even before the pandemic hit. Much of these costs are preventable by investing in policies and programmes that address the root causes of poor mental health, particularly poverty. We cannot afford to sit on the side lines and watch the impending mental health crisis develop.`,

    content: `GPs in the UK have some of the highest stress levels and lowest job satisfaction among family doctors, a 10-country survey has found.

    British GPs suffer from high levels of burnout, have a worse work/life balance and spend less time with patients during appointments than their peers in many other places.
    
    Heavy workloads, seemingly endless paperwork and feelings of emotional distress are prompting many GPs to stop seeing patients regularly or even retire altogether, the research found.
    
    Seven in 10 (71%) NHS family doctors find their job “extremely” or “very stressful”, the joint-highest number alongside GPs in Germany among the countries analysed.`,

    content: "While the foundations of brain structure and function are laid during pregnancy and early life, the brain is constantly being fuelled and shaped by the food and drink we consume daily. We should be thinking of brain health like a pension plan; it is best to start as early as possible so that you have more to draw from when you need it. That said, it is never too late to invest in your brain health. Here is how to use nutrition to aid the brain at each stage of life.",

    content: `A new study has found that the pandemic has severely affected people’s mental health and relationships all over the world, particularly for young adults.

    The third annual mental state of the world report (MSW) commissioned by Sapien Labs, a non-profit research organization, conducted a global survey to better understand the state of mental health.
    The research compiled responses from over 400,000 participants across 64 countries, asking respondents about their family relationships, friendships and overall mental wellbeing `,

    content: `Who is affected by automatic negative thoughts?
    The focus of decades of research and refinement, ANTs tend to strike when we’re anxious or depressed. While most of us succumb to cognitive distortions like these at least occasionally, it only becomes a problem when done chronically or to extremes, says Jacqueline Samson, a psychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
    
    "They’re extremely common, and all of them can lead to a certain amount of misery," she says. "When people get into a negative state of mind, it’s really easy to remember all the bad things someone said or did to you, and hard to remember your successes."`,

    content: `Meditation isn’t for everyone. Or at least not when life has taken you so far from calm that your brain is soup. “It’s the nature of the mind to have this ongoing conversation in the background,” says Joy Rains, a mindfulness practitioner and author of Meditation Illuminated: Simple Ways to Manage Your Busy Mind. “I call this ‘Stuff’, which is an acronym for stories, thoughts, urges, frustrations and feelings. When you’re in a meditative state, you’re in the here and now and you’re releasing your Stuff. You’re not getting caught up in judgments, thoughts about the past, worries about the future.”

    There is a growing body of evidence that “releasing our Stuff” like this is an effective antidote to 21st-century life, helping us to concentrate, remember things and become more self-aware, while reducing anxiety, depression and stress. The good news is that we don’t have to be brilliant at sitting still and focusing on our breath to get meditation’s recuperating benefits, says psychologist Suzy Reading. Despite also being a yoga teacher, Reading admits to having struggled with traditional meditation practices, “and they are inaccessible for a lot of people. But that’s not to say that meditation is not for them.”`,

    image: "https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/13202/e39009dc-0e75-4af7-bc25-9caba644b7cc.jpg",
    content: `One of the many forms mental illness may take is psychosis. People experiencing it may have hallucinations (hearing voices, seeing visions, or feeling sensations that are not real) or delusions (firmly fixed beliefs that are not based on reality). And often, a first experience of psychosis occurs in the teenage or young adult years.

    Could identifying early warning signs of psychosis and providing appropriate support change the course of the illness for the better? Experts believe that it can.`,
